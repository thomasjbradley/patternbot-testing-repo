The buttons use our primary colour to draw attention and stand out. Each button has a specific purpose:

- The regular buttons are for cards, forms and where the background is a light colour
- The light buttons are for dark background areas
- The ghost buttons should be used exclusively on banners where the background is an image

Feel free to mix them with the `font-size` classes to make different sizes of buttons.
